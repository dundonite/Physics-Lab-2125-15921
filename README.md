## Running Lab Reports

This project uses Jupyter and Mercury to render basic lab reports. Install them as you see fit and run them from the base directory.

1. Enter your information into the form on the left-hand side.
1. Upload a CSV file that matches the structure of the example CSV in the source directory. Column names do not matter and will be overwritten.
1. Use the download button to download as HTML. Downloading as PDF will not work (idk).
1. Open the html file in your browser and then "print as PDF".

The most recent lab should serve as the working example, others may not work as expected.

## Backlog

- [x] Move to [Mercury](https://runmercury.com/) so that people can type in data and print a lab report without manipulating source data files.
- [ ] SSL on port 443
- [x] Support for multiple reports
- [x] Support for uploading files
- [ ] Add automatic build process for html and pdf (for demo, doc, and local dev)
